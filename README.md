# Plant-Pathology

Develop a CNN(Convolutional neural network) model to identify plant diseases using transfer learning. Optimize the model using intel OpenVino Toolkit to gernerate BIN, IR and MAPPING files. The goal of optimization is, to reduce the time of computation during inferencing. later, inference the optimized model using Intel OpenVino inferencing engine in local work station(Ubuntu 18.x) as well as in intel dev cloud edge. Inferencing is tested in several EDGE Nodes,

a. TensorFlow Model to detect 4 diseases(Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Curl, Leaf Mold) of Tomato as well as healthy leaf-(*please check the file "tsiailab_tomato_diseases_solution.ipynb" to generate the TensorFlow Model)

b. TensorFlow Model to detect 2 diseases of Potato(Early Blight and Late Blight) as well as healthy leaf-(*please check the file "tsiailab_potato_diseases_solution.ipynb" to generate the TensorFlow Model)

c. TensorFlow Model to detect 3 diseases of Maize(Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot and Northern Leaf Blight) as well as helathy leaf-
(*please check the file "tsiailab_maize_diseases_solution.ipynb" to generate the TensorFlow Model)
